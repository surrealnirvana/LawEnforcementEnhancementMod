## **Whatâ€™s in Store for Your Criminal Career?**

### ðŸ•’ **Dynamic Patrols**
- **Morning:** The early bird gets the wormâ€¦ but donâ€™t expect much heat. The cops are still sipping their coffee (*33% capacity*).  
- **Afternoon:** Things start to pick up. Neighborhoods are bustling, and so are the patrols (*50% capacity*).  
- **Evening:** The streets are alive, and so are the sirens. Time to watch your back (*66% capacity*).  
- **Night:** The gloves are off. Itâ€™s a game of cat and mouse, and you just heard a meow (*100% capacity*).

And donâ€™t even THINK about 9:00 PMâ€”because when the **9:00 PM Maximum Protocol** kicks in, the cops will flood the streets like theyâ€™re auditioning for an action movie.

### ðŸ‘® **Smarter Cops, Bigger Problems**
- **Patrol Routes 2.0:** No more lazy loops. These officers have upgraded to smarter patrol routes with customizable waypoints.  
- **Realistic Reactions:** Did you really think you could just jaywalk after selling some "oregano"? Think again. Every action you take could trigger an on-the-spot reaction.  
- **Officer Variety:** From rookies with pepper spray to seasoned veterans packing some serious heat, the force is more diverseâ€”and unpredictableâ€”than ever.

### ðŸ¤– **Performance-Friendly**
- Officers despawn when youâ€™re out of sight, keeping the game smooth while you sweat bullets.
